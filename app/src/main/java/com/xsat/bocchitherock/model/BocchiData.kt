She is in the first year of Shuka High School and is in charge of the guitar and lyrics of the band, Kessoku Band. \\n\\nAn extremely timid and introverted first-year student in high school. She is in charge of the responsibility of playing the lead guitar for Kessoku Band. She aspires to perform in a band that could showcase even a reserved girl\\'s talent, hence she began playing the guitar. Although her skill is the real deal, she struggles to exhibit it proficiently in a band or in front of an audience. Additionally, she possesses a habit of saying \"Ah\" before she speaks. \\n\\nHitori struggles with interpersonal relationships and often shies away from first encounters. She is frequently seen wearing a jersey and spends most of her time at home playing the guitar in a dark closet, hardly ever venturing out. Whenever a situation arises, she tries to hide in a trash can, cardboard box, or other objects, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard box. Despite her attempts to liven things up, she usually fails, either by slipping up or overdoing it. She craves approval from others, likely as a reaction to her personality. She is also, however, aware that she tends to scrutinize others and often feels pressured and anxious."

Also, it was known that she always saved a spot, wanting Kessoku Band to play even though she pretended she did not want them to. She also sleeps with her soft toys despite her age."
